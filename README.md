# My Portfolio Online [L-JSON]

Hi, this is my online Portfolio. 👨🏽‍💻

__I am currently working on this__ and I only deployed the first version with home 🌱

if you want to see the portfolio it is here -> [Porfolio](https://lautaro-json.vercel.app/home)




## Tecnologies 🛠
This web page uses, as its main framework, NextJS with React.

As a programming language it uses typescript (*this is unnecessary but, I love typescript*).

For styles and animations used a normal css global module, and for components, styled-components <💅🏽>

And finally the page was deployed with vercel 💪
